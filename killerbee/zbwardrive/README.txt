README: zbwardrive 

zbWarDrive is a tool that seeks to achieve optimal coverage of
networks with using only the available capture interfaces. It uses all
availble devices, injecting and listening to channels in
parallel. Once a network is found, it listens and logs the packets to
a PCAP file for a short period of time.
